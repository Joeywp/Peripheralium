If for some reason you want to use it, tell me, I will provide maven repository for this one.

This library cointains a lot of staff, that allows anyone to build peripheral in more flexible and configurable way.

Highlighted library modules:
- Peripheral plugin part, that allows you to not overwrite another peripheral completly, but provide additional functionallity for it
- Pluggable versions of generic peripherals, such as inventory, fluid_storage and energy_storage.
- item_storage peripheral implementation
- Expandable collection of tools to tranform data from and to lua-compatable objects
- Cross-loader platform tools
- Base block entities for peripherals
